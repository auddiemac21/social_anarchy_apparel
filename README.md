Company info:
For far too long we as a people have been told that we have the freedom of speech, that we can openly express ourselves through art and other various types of media, only to be told we can't say, do or draw certain things. Well not anymore. This is our stance. This is our fight. Our freedoms won't be ignored. 

Here at Social Anarchy we firmly believe in our freedoms. Our shirts are our voices and our canvases. 

We have plenty of topics to choose from, including charity shirts (you don't pay more, we just make less), so buy a shirt and join the Social Anarchy Army. 

Gear up, speak out and #JointheRevolution.
